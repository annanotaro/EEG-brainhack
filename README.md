# EEG-brainhack

Welcome to the Brainhack project **"I Know What You Will Do: Forecasting Motor Behaviour from EEG Time Series"**.  
This repository contains tools, scripts, and documentation aimed at developing a deep learning solution for forecasting EEG time series to predict motor behavior.

## Dataset

We use the publicly available **WAY-EEG-GAL-ML** dataset, which contains EEG recordings related to motor activity.

EEG Neural Signal Extraction with ICA
This code processes an EEG dataset to isolate clean neural signals using ICA. Starting from preprocessed EEG data  we applied a bandpass filter (1â€“40 Hz), re-referenced to common average, and set a standard 10â€“20 montage. Using MNE and mne-icalabel, we performed ICA to decompose signals and classify components (brain, eye blink, muscle artifact). Only components labeled as "brain" were retained and saved as a NumPy array for further analysis.
